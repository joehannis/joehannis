Software engineer and former business owner with proven experience in AI/LLM engineering, JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.JS, React, Google Cloud, CI/CD pipelines and SQL and NoSQL databases. With a decade of business ownership, I excel in communicating complex concepts to stakeholders, with the self motivation to learn and independently deliver. I have demonstrated my ability to learn new technologies quickly and to apply them to real-world problems, always with the user at the centre of the solution. I thrive when problem solving in challenging environments.

| Name                         | Description       | Tech/tools        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| [**zendeskAI**](https://tinylink.net/y4Ych)                 |Built for Pendo, this project is designed to integrate Zendesk and Jira, leveraging Generative AI to enhance ticket management and documentation processes. It allows for the fetching of tickets from Zendesk, tagging them using AI, and generating documentation by comparing tickets with existing articles using text embeddings. It includes an internal rate limiter and chunking logic to avoid API rate limiting.| Zendesk API, JIRA API, Google Gemini SDK, Google Cloud SDK, Google Datastore, Firebase, OpenAI SDK, Babel, Express.js |
| [**pendoRunner**](https://tinylink.net/ICx0e)                 |A tool built for Pendo to streamline operations in Technical Support and Professional Services. Generative AI is used to create the body of POST requests to endpoints that use a proprietary pipeline. The request and body are shown in a code editor, and once a response is received, a JSON filter can be used to filter and export data to CSV.| React, Motion, Google Gemini SDK, Monaco Editor, Express.js |
| [**Taplist Keg Level Manager**](https://tinyurl.com/26pfusx3)                 |Solo personal project, open-source and currently pulled over 7000 times from Docker Hub. A Docker image that utilises GitHub Actions/Workflow for CI/CD. Docker-compose uses buildx to make the image multi-architecture (currently ARM64 and AMD64 for MacOS and Linux). This React site integrates with taplist.io using API calls to track keg volume levels. The remaining keg volume is displayed on my digital taplist. A README details how an Arduino can be added to automate the process with flow sensors, with code provided.| React, JavaScript, Docker, Docker-Compose, Github Actions, HTML, CSS, Jest, Cypress, VS Code |
| [**Trail**](https://trail-production.up.railway.app/)            | Greenfield React app created in a four person engineering team in two weeks. API calls to Google Cloud and Open AI services to generate audio tours. Link to my presentation about the app & Github link. Hosted on Railway.
